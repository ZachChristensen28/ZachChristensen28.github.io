Traditional reactive models are no longer sufficient in today's cyber threat landscape. [PRE Security](https://presecurity.ai){: target="blank" } was founded on a bold premise: **what if organizations could predict cyber events before they cause damage**, much like the weatherman predicts the weather?

Turning this vision into a reality required addressing a longstanding cybersecurity challenge: **data ingestion and normalization**.

## Solving the Data Normalization Challenge

Security teams familiar with conventional SIEM solutions know the burden of data normalization.

Integrating new data sources typically requires:

- Custom parsers or technical add-ons,
- Extensive engineering resources,
- Ongoing maintenance to adapt to changing log formats.

PRE Security eliminates this burned through its patent-pending parserless technology, **Log-to-Natural Language Processor (log2NLP)**. Log2NLP automatically normalizes security data across disparate sources — without requiring manual configuration or engineering intervention. This innovation significantly reduces time-to-value, operational overhead, and long-term maintenance costs.

## Dynamic Detection and Prediction Powered by GenAI

PRE Security's advantage extends beyond normalization. Leveraging **advanced Generative AI (GenAI)** capabilities, the platform dynamically detects threats and predicts potential cyberattacks before they occur.

Key capabilities include:

- Risk and anomaly-based scoring to ensure high-fidelity alerts with minimal false positives.
- Context-rich, correlated detections to enhance analyst efficiency.
- Dynamic adaptation based on live data ingestion, rather than relying solely on static rules or historical models.

## Lowering the Learning Curve: Natural Language Interaction

PRE Security redefines analyst engagement through **natural language**. Instead of requiring specialized query languages, analysts can interact with the system conversationally, accelerating onboarding, enhancing accessibility, and enabling immediate operational impact.

For example, analysts can simply type, "Show potential ransomware threats," to receive actionable insights — no complex syntax required.

## Immediate Action with Integrated SOARGPT and SOCGPT

PRE Security integrates tightly with **SOARGPT**, enabling users to initiate immediate mitigations based on AI-guided recommendations. This may include generating targeted communications to impacted users or executing predefined response workflows.

Additionally, **SOCGPT** — an AI-driven virtual analyst — empowers teams to:

- Query environmental risks,
- Request predictive reports (e.g., "Which countries are most likely to attack us?"),
- Clarify security codes and protocols in real time,
- Use voice commands for hands-free data interrogation.

SOCGPT synthesizes historical patterns, live threat intelligence, and organizational context to generate actionable outputs that can be shared with key stakeholders.

## Why PRE Security?

In a world of escalating threats and limited resources, PRE Security delivers material advantages:

- **Accelerated deployment** through parserless ingestion,
- **Reduced operational costs** with no-ingest-based pricing,
- **Proactive risk mitigation** via AI-driven predictions and contextual detections.

PRE Security empowers organizations to shift from reactive incident response to proactive threat anticipation — strengthening defenses before an attack materializes.
